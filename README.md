# Personal Website

This repository is for my personal website! I am building it using HTML, CSS, and GitHub pages, using lessons from Codecademy.
I am currently using this Codecademy course to learn HTML and CSS: https://www.codecademy.com/enrolled/paths/learn-how-to-build-websites
I plan on updating the site daily to include new information and upgrade the visual presentation.
